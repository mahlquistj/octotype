# Typers - A lightweight typing trainer for your terminal

Typers is a simple TUI typing trainer made with [Ratatui](ratatui) and heavily inspired by [Monkeytype](monkeytype)

## ‚ùìWhy

I made this when i got a new split keyboard while trying to get into vim.
I found myself using [Monkeytype](monkeytype) a lot, and needed a project to work on to not only practice my keyboard
skills, but also something to do in my new neovim setup.

This lead to Typers, which is almost a monkeytype clone (At least regarding calculations) which just runs in the terminal instead.
