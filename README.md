### Nix

You can add OctoType as a Flake:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    octotype.url = "github:mahlquistj/octotype/main";
  };
  
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, rio }: {
    nixosConfigurations.hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            octotype.packages.${pkgs.system}.octotype
          ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

No package exists in nixpkgs _yet_.

## ❓ Why another typing-trainer?

It all started as a fun side-project to learn typing on my new [ZSA Moonlander]
keyboard. I was inspired by using [Monkeytype] a lot, but found that i was
missing more customizability when it came to what modes and words i could get.
