# OctoType - A lightweight typing trainer for your terminal

OctoType is a simple TUI typing trainer made with [Ratatui](ratatui) and heavily inspired by [Monkeytype](monkeytype)

## üîç Features

- Configurable - Configure the theme, custom profiles and more!

## ‚ùì Why

I made this when i got a new split keyboard while trying to get into vim.
I found myself using [Monkeytype](monkeytype) a lot (Which is where the inspiration came from), and needed a project to work on to not only practice my keyboard
skills, but also something to do in my new neovim setup that wasn't too heavy.
