If you've found that OctoType does something it's _definitely not_ supposed to
do, try to make sure it's not on your end first - Feel free to ask in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/zk4SXvdUxj) if you're in doubt!

If it's not on your end, and no other issue already exists regarding this,
please don't hesitate to
[open an issue](https://github.com/mahlquistj/octotype/issues/new?template=bug.yml)!

<div class="article-links">
