Using AI is not in any way prohibited, but we expect AI usage to be
[a tool and nothing more](pull-requests#all-code-is-treated-as-your-own).

Copilot is enabled for every pull-request for a high-level understanding of the
changes - Reviews are still expected to be done by a human.

I, the maintainer, use Claude for brainstorming, generating trivial code and
high-level scaffolding - Nothing more.
