title: Using AI
sidebar_position: 1

Using AI is not in any way prohibited, but AI usage is expected to be
[a tool and nothing more](/docs/contributing/development#all-code-is-treated-as-your-own).

Copilot is enabled for every pull-request for a high-level understanding of the
changes - Reviews are still expected to be done by a human.

I, the maintainer, use Claude for brainstorming, planning, writing docs,
generating trivial code and high-level scaffolding - Everything is at least
verified by me before pushing.
